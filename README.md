 > * I would suggest increasing the presence of drivers in rural areas. The average per farr ride and average fare per driver is higher in rural areas. Rural fares may be longer destiantions in length, and this is resulting in the available drivers being unavailable. By increasing the presences of drivers, this could peak revenue.
